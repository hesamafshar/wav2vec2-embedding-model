## 🧠 Project Description

The goal of this project is to explore and implement the Wav2Vec2 model, including its application to speech recognition and representation learning. This includes:

- Understanding the architecture of the Wav2Vec2 model.
- Working with pre-trained models or training from scratch.
- Visualizing speech features and embeddings.
- Investigating performance on audio datasets.

## 📚 Resources

- Based on the Facebook AI Research paper: *"wav2vec 2.0: A Framework for Self-Supervised Learning of Speech Representations"*
- Hugging Face Transformers library is used for model loading and inference.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `Wav2Vec2_ASR_Training.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
3. Install dependencies if needed:  
   ```bash
   pip install transformers torchaudio librosa
